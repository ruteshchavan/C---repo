/* The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" 
   which means many forms.
   
   Let's consider a real-life example of polymorphsim. A lady behaves like a
   teacher in a classroom, mother or daughter in a home and customer in a 
   market. Here, a single person is behaving differently accord to the situations.

   There are 2 types of poly : 
   1. compile time poly.
   2. run-time poly.

   Compile time polymorphism :
   1.The overloaded functions are invoked by matching the type and number of arguments.
   2.The function is invoked at the compile time.
   3.It is also known as overloading, early binding and static binding.
   4.Overloading is a compile time polymorphism where more than one method is having 
     the same name but with the different number of parameters or the type of the parameters.
   5.It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.

   Run time polymorphism: 
   1.Run time polymorphism is achieved when the object's method is invoked
     at the run time instead of compile time.
   2.The function is invoked at the run time.
   3.Overriding is a run time polymorphism where more than one method is 
     having the same name, number of parameters and the type of the parameters.
   4.It is also known as overriding, Dynamic binding and late binding.
   5.It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.
