// Hello World program...
// C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.
// C++ programming language was developed in 1980 by Bjarne Stroustrup.
// C++ Librarie's are divided into 3 parts : 
// The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
// The standard library includes the set of functions, manipulating strings, files, etc.
// The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.
// The 4 major pillar's of OOPs - Inheritance , Polymorphism , Abstraction , Encapsulation.
// C++ is a superset of C programming language. C++ can run 99% of C code but C language cannot run C++ code.
// C++ supports 52 keywords.
// C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to perform input and output operations.
// insertion operator (<<) used in output stream ( cout << )
// extraction operator (>>) used in input stream ( cin >> )
// cin is an input statement while cout is an output statement.
// cin - character input / cout - chracter output / endl - end line.
// The C++ goto statement is also known as jump statement.It is used to transfer control to the other part of the program.

    C is the procedural oriented programming.         C++ supports both procedural and object oriented.
    C follows the top-down approach.                  C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
    C does not support function overloading.          C++ supports function overloading.
    C does not support the inheritance.               C++ supports inheritance.
