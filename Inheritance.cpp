/* 
// Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors 
     of its parents class/object.

// C++ supports five types of inheritance:
     Single inheritance
     Multiple inheritance
     Hierarchical inheritance
     Multilevel inheritance
     Hybrid inheritance

// Subclass-Subclass or Derived Class refers to a class that receives properties from another class.
// Superclass-The term "Base Class" or "Super Class" refers to the class from which a subclass inherits its properties.


// When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance.
// Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.
// Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.
// Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.
